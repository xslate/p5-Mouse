Revision history for Mouse

0.72 Sat Sep 25 20:47:51 2010
    [BUG FIXES]
    * Internal refatoring has removed a number of incompatibilities
      in Mouse::PurePerl.
    * Error messages from duck types are now compatible with Moose.

0.71 Fri Sep 24 19:51:04 2010
    [CHANGES]
    * Inheritance from non-Mouse classes now produces warnings.
      Use MouseX::Foreign if you want this type of inheritance.
    * A new module Mouse::Meta::Role::Application has been added.
      It doesn not affect public APIs, but internals are radically
      changed. For users, using Mouse without roles should consume
      less memory.

    [BUG FIXES]
    * Meta class reinitialization caused by Mouse::Util::MetaRole
      did not work correctly

0.70 Fri Sep 17 19:07:02 2010
    [BUG FIXES]
    * Delegations ignored method modifiers

0.69 Mon Sep 13 14:04:41 2010
    [BUG FIXES]
    * Workaround a problem with Test::Builder 2.00_01, which could cause
      SEGV (the HEAD in the repository of tb2 is okay)

0.68 Sat Sep 11 16:24:42 2010
    [CHANGES]
    * Remove an optional depenency, Data::Util.
      This is used to make method modifiers faster, but the effect
      is limited to 'before' and 'after' modifiers. Rather,
      D::U's modifiers are slightly different from the standalone version,
      and sometimes the difference caused problems.

0.67 Fri Sep 10 13:56:38 2010
    [BUG FIXES]
    * Oops! Fix a mistake of removing neccesary denepdencies

0.66 Fri Sep 10 13:30:41 2010

0.65 Thu Sep 9 13:30:33 2010
    [CHANGES]

      (Moose 1.07 feature)
    * Remove long deprecated methods:
      _create_args(), compute_all_applicable_attributes(),
      and clone_instance()

    [BUG FIXES]
    * Fix tests that misused test functions. This problem was revealed
      by Test::Builder2
    * Improve C++ compatibility in Mouse::XS

0.64 Mon Jul 26 20:48:13 2010
    [BUG FIXES]
    * Build failure on 5.13.3

    [CHANGES]
    * Illegal inheritance options for clone_and_inherit_options()
      is now a black list, not a white list (Moose 1.09 feature)
    * Remove long deprecated methods in Mouse::Meta::Attribute:
        clone_parent, get_parent_args, canonicalize_args, create

0.63 Tue Jul 20 19:26:30 2010

0.51 Mon Mar 15 15:25:58 2010
    SUMMARY

    [BUG FIXES]
    * Mouse::Object::DESTROY could cause SEGVs
    * Attribute triggers could cause panics
    * Integers > 2**32 were not groked as Int
    * Incorrect types, e.g. "Array[Int", was accepted
    * Metaclass compatibility was sometimes ignored

    [MOOSE COMPATIBILITY]
    * before/around/after accept regular expressions
    * has() becomes strict
    * the global destruction flag is passed to DEMOLISH methods
    * Delegations can be curried
    * Built-in type constraints have the same hierarchy as Moose's


0.50_09 Mon Mar 15 12:02:28 2010
    * (re)fix RT #55048 to grok 2**46+0.5 as Int, but
      accept 2**46 as Int even on 32 bit environments;
      note that an Int is exactly what is matched to /^[+-]?[0-9]+$/,
      so 10e100 will not be groked as Int (gfx)

0.50_08 Thu Mar 11 19:28:58 2010
    * Makefile.PL
        - Resolved #55419: Add Devel::PPPort to build_requires (gfx)
    * Mouse::Exporter
        - Turns on warnings FATAL => 'recursion' by default (gfx)
    * Mouse::Util::TypeConstraints
        - Change the type parser to check syntax (gfx)
          (Now it throws erros to "ArrayRef[]", "ArrayRef[Int", etc.)

0.50_07 Sun Mar  7 19:59:37 2010
    * Mouse::Meta::Attribute
        - Fix a possible panic, caused by triggers, reported by

0.50_05 Mon Mar  1 11:18:26 2010
    * Mouse::Util::TypeConstraints
        - Mouse used an incorrect cast at the C-level which meant that
          its idea of numbers was different from that of Perl's (and
          Mouse's). Notably > 2**32 Integers on 32 bit systems didn't
          work, RT #55048 (AEvar).
    * Mouse::Meta::Classs
        - Fix an issue on metaclass compatibility (gfx)

0.50_04 Fri Feb 26 18:57:24 2010

          - If an attribute generates no accessors, it will be warned
          - If both 'isa' and 'does' are specified and 'isa' does not do
            'does', then it will be warned

0.20 Thu Apr 9 20:22:33 2009
    * Squirrel is now deprecated. Use Any::Moose instead (Sartak)

    * To improve Moose compat, the third argument to trigger
      (the attribute metaobject) has been removed (Sartak)

    * To improve Moose compat, a single undef passed to new
      is now disallowed (Sartak)

    * Implemented Mouse::Object->does (wu-lee)

    * Implemented override and super functions for Mouse::Role.
      (wu-lee)

    * Implemented stub augment and inner functions for Mouse::Role,
      which merely throw an exception as in Moose::Role. (wu-lee)

    * Stole more tests from Moose (020_roles/*).  Not all these pass
      yet; the rest have been moved to 020_roles/failing for later
      examination. (wu-lee)

    * Implemented Mouse::Role->does_role.  This does not yet quite
      seem to pass all the tests it should. (wu-lee)

    * Fixed bug in Mouse::Meta::Role->apply and ->combine_apply, so that
      030_roles/002_role.t tests pass. (wu-lee)

    * Implemented ->version, ->authority and ->identifier methods in
      Mouse::Meta::Role and Mouse::Meta::Class (mainly to make more
      Moose tests pass). (wu-lee)

    * Implemented emulations of Class::MOP's metaclass accessors
      (get_metaclass_by_name etc.) in Mouse::Meta::Class.

    * Mouse attribute property 'isa' now accepts Role names. (wu-lee)

    * Fixed bug: typecoercion application order was reversed. (wu-lee)

      wrong order. (wu-lee)

    * Fixed bug: immutable constructor now redispatches correctly to
      Mouse::Object::new when used in derived classes (wu-lee).

    * Maybe parameterized type constraint (lestrrat)

    * Performance improvements! (tokuhirom)

    * Improve Moose compat of class_type (lestrrat)

    * Many type-constraint fixes (tokuhirom and lestrrat)

    * Mouse::Meta::Class->has_method and ->get_attribute_list (tokuhirom)

    * Add get_all_attributes, use it internally instead of
      compute_all_applicable_attributes (nothingmuch)

0.19 Sun Mar 8 04:38:01 2009
    * Parameterized type constraints for ArrayRef and HashRef (lestrrat)

      available (Sartak)

0.18 Fri Mar 6 19:09:33 2009

    * Load mro directly if Perl is recent enough (Nicholas Clark)

    * Add dump method from Moose::Object into Mouse::Object (perigrin)

    * Add role-role composition (tokuhirom)

0.16 Mon Feb 9 20:56:27 2009
    * Implement get_all_method_names

    * Support for anonymous enums: enum [elements]

    * Moose's make_immutable returns true allowing calling code to skip
      setting an explicit true value at the end of a source file. (obra)

0.15 Thu Feb 5 11:44:05 2009
    * Don't export Mouse's sugar into the package 'main'

    * Rename Mouse::TypeRegistry to Mouse::Util::TypeConstraints

    * "type" sugar for when you're not subtyping anything

    * Keep track of the source package of each type

    * Moose lets you redefine a type within the same package, so we now do too

    * Borrow more of Moose's meta API

    * Mouse::Util::TypeConstraints now uses Exporter so you can select which
      sugar you want

    * class_type shouldn't load the class (Moose compat; no easy fix :/)

    * suppress warnings when we use "around" and "has '+...'" (dann)

    * use Data::Util to make method modifiers fast if it's available (dann)

    * Implement "enum" type constraints

    * Implement "override" and "super"

    * MouseX::Types is now in its own dist

0.14 Sat Dec 20 16:53:05 2008
    * POD fix

    * Document what changes tokuhirom and Yappo made (see below)

0.13 Tue Dec 16 02:01:40 2008
    * Pass in the instance to the default sub in the constructor (reported with
      failing tests by rjbs)

    * Tons of new features implemented by tokuhirom++ and Yappo++:
      - method API in classes and roles!
      - "requires" and "with" for Mouse::Role
      - Type coercion
      - Inject a constructor after make_immutable. Huge speedup!
      - class_type and role_type
      - Inject a destructor for more speedup
      - MouseX::Types (may move into its own dist)
      - create_anon_class
      - union type constraints (eg 'Str | Undef')
      - subtypes and sugar for them

0.12 Thu Dec 4 19:23:10 2008
    * Provide Test::Exception function unless it's version 0.27 - RT #41254

    * Mouse::Util now provides dies_ok

    * Make class-like types behave more like Moose; subclasses OK! (rjbs)

    * Steal more tests from Moose

0.11 Sun Nov 2 11:35:04 2008
    * Throw an error if accessor/predicate/clearer/handles code eval fails

    * Optimizations for generated methods, they should now be on par with Moose

0.10 Tue Oct 28 19:23:07 2008
    * Require a recent Moose (which has the bugfix) for
      t/500_moose_extends_mouse.t

    * ouse.pm for perl -Mouse one-liners (thanks rjbs)

    * Doc for init_arg => undef (thanks rjbs)

0.09 Sun Sep 28 22:37:13 2008
    * Initial version of Mouse::Tiny, a one-file concatenation of the Mouse
      classes for easy embedding

    * Fixes caused by test failures (Carp not being loaded, Moose being
      required in a test)

0.08 Sun Sep 28 12:46:07 2008
    * ALL dependencies have been removed!

    * Fixes for Class::Method::Modifiers being required for testing

0.07 Sun Sep 28 00:19:07 2008
    * All runtime dependencies have been removed! The only change in
      functionality (hopefully) is that the Sub::Exporter features can no
      longer be used (we've backed down to regular Exporter). Scalar::Util is
      required for "weaken" support, and Class::Method::Modifiers is required
      for method modifier support, but only if you use these features!
      Having Scalar::Util and MRO::Compat installed will provide only
      performance increases.

    * Tests and fixes for extending a Mouse class with Moose (nothingmuch)

    * Support for adding method modifiers to a role, and composing them into
      classes (we'll get true methods some day)

    * Method modifiers now go through the metaclass instead of invoking
      Class::Method::Modifiers directly

    * Remove the deprecated before/after/around triggers

    * Roles keywords 'requires' and 'excludes' now throw errors instead of
      silently doing nothing (they aren't implemented yet)

0.06 Thu Jul 23 02:10:07 2008
    * Deprecating before/after/around triggers! Switch back to coderef +
      whatever you used to do. Moose is have it implemented it as an extension
      trait.

    * Mouse
      - updated trigger doc (thanks perigrin)
        - which will not see CPAN :( sorry perigrin!

    * Mouse::Meta::Class
      - add a make_immutable method which does nothing(!), for even more
        Moose compat (nothingmuch's idea)

0.05 Thu Jul 17 01:53:20 2008
    * Mouse::Role
      Mouse::Meta::Role
      Mouse
      Squirrel::Role
      - Begin adding roles! Attributes are mostly there. Still experimental.

    * Mouse::Meta::Class
      Mouse::Object
      - Add clone_object and clone_instance (nothingmuch)

    * Mouse::Object
      - Add BUILDARGS (nothingmuch)

    * Mouse::Meta::Attribute
      Mouse::Object
      - Add "before" and "around" triggers. Moose doesn't even have them yet! :)

    * Everywhere
      - Improvements to the MOP (e.g. Class->add_method)

    * (build)
      - Excise dependency on Test::Warn, we only used it in one simple test

0.04 Tue Jun 17 04:56:36 2008
    * Mouse
      Mouse::Meta::Attribute
      - Add support for has '+name'
      - Add lazy_build (nothingmuch)

0.03 Thu Jun 12 21:54:07 2008
    * Mouse
      - Add before/after/around, courtesy of Class::Method::Modifiers

    * Mouse::Object
      - Add support for ->new({...})
      - Use compute_all_applicable_attributes in the constructor to get the
        attributes of superclasses
      - Add better support for undef init_arg

    * Mouse::Meta::Class
      - More methods: compute_all_applicable_attributes, has_attribute

0.02 Wed Jun 11 01:56:44 2008
    * Squirrel
      - Add Squirrel which acts as Moose if it's already loaded, otherwise
        Mouse (thanks nothingmuch)

    * Mouse::Meta::Object
      - Fix the order in which BUILD methods are called (thanks Robert
        Boone)
